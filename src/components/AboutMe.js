            <h1>Designing with Purpose and Passion</h1>
            <p>
              Hello! I'm <strong>Dan Dougherty</strong>, a UX Designer fueled by creativity and a drive to craft intuitive, user-centric experiences. I believe that great design marries functionality with aesthetics, creating solutions that are both beautiful and purposeful.
            </p>
            <p>
              From initial sketches to high-fidelity prototypes, I approach every project with energy and innovation, always aiming to exceed user expectations. When I'm not immersed in design, you might find me fine-tuning an engine, where attention to detail is key, or exploring mountain trails, fueled by a love for discoveryâ€”both of which mirror my dedication to problem-solving and adventure.
